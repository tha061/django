  "description": "Sleep Booster  is a perfect sleep solution for those who would like to fall asleep easily and wake up energized with the help of special breathing technique, meditation sessions, calming sounds  and refreshing alarm melodies.  Sleep Booster  is based on the only extremely effective \ud83d\ude80drug-free \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f option for overcoming sleeping problems. Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits\u2728.  \u2b50\ufe0f  HOW SLEEP BOOSTER WORKS \u2b50\ufe0f  Falling asleep: Deep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep.  \u2b50\ufe0f  Sleep retention: Breathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning. \u2b50\ufe0f  Awakening: After a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.   \u2b50\ufe0f  WHY DO YOU NEED SLEEP BOOSTER?
