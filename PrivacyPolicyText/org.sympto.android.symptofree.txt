We do recommend you study the Manual 'The Complete Symptothermal Guide' avalable on our website for download free of charge. If you do not want to study the Learning Manual on your own  you have the option of contacting a symptothermal counselor. There will be a fee set by her for this service.  If you choose unlimited access to sympto.org  there will be no consultation service included. 'Unlimited' means that the access on your sympto.org account is guaranteed as long as the SymptoTherm Foundation can uphold this service. In case of an accident within our principal server  we decline all liability. However  your data is regularly backed up on a second server. If you do not use your unlimited sympto.org account for more than one year  sympto.org is entitled to demand a reactivation fee before use or cancelation of your account. An unlimited account cannot be transferred: sympto.org will cancel all unlimited accounts whenever the email address has changed  unless this change has been approved by sympto.org. The client cannot delete her account because of possible abuse but she can ask sympto.org to deactivate it. The SymptoTherm Foundation does not sell any of your data to third parties.  If you lose your cell phone  all data which you have transferred and thus saved to your sympto.org account can be retrieved. All your data is treated confidentially. Sync your data weekly to have it backed up in your web account. You may incur transmission costs for synchronization if you are using an older generation device. Theses costs are negligible and displayed in your account.  Your sympto.org account provides you with a full chart of your cycle. The cell phone chart cannot display the complete representation of all your cycle data nor can it offer all the features of your home account on sympto.org.  We recommend that you print out your charts periodically as soon as your cycle is completed. The charts provide you with a permanent record of your gynecological history. You can send them to whoever you like for discussion and analysis either as an attachment or via a internet link that you have to activate in the settings of your account. The chart is the only serious basis for discussion whenever you are concerned about irregular cycles or other problems. It contains valuable information.  While keeping your identity totally confidential  the sympto.org website may use your data for statistical purposes in order to improve knowledge of the female cycle and to disseminate the effectiveness of the STM.   Additional service features if you are pregnant or breastfeeding  Whenever you suspend your observations because of a pregnancy or any other reason  your contract continus according to your payment. sympto is still useful as it can become your pregnancy diary. it also indicates the probable day of your delivery.  When your contract expires  your cycles start being deleted as follows: the system always stores the previous 360 days. If  for example  you resume your observations on the 11th month after a pause of several months  your last cycle will still be there and the data stored in you cycle chart will serve as a basis for the future. But once a year has elapsed  we cannot guarantee you the storage of the files.  Disclaimer  No woman or couple can ever be absolutely certain of avoiding an unwanted pregnancy. Even the best contraception can fail. In such a case  the woman or the couple has to decide on their own whether they want to take responsibility for the child. We do not accuse anybody of actively promoting abortion. Teenagers who do not have regular biphasic cycles can use sympto ch to improve their fertility awareness (knowledge about ovulation) but not for contraceptive purposes.  sympto.ch does not protect you against sexually transmitted diseases. The sympto.ch system has been developed by Symptotherm Foundation  according to article 4 of its Foundation chart  in order to improve and facilitate the learning process and make the use of the STM more attractive. The sympto.ch system makes cycle observations easier but it does not make them redundant: the woman remains the only person responsible for her observations. F. i. she must know how and when she has to discard problematic temperatures. The SymptoTherm Basics booklet contains the elementary information about the female cycle needed to fully understand the User's Manual and the FAQ of this website.  Symptotherm Foundation can change the User's Manual (Learning Manual) at any time without any previous warning according to the system?s adaptations to its environment.  The fertility indications processed by sympto.org all aim at the same goal: facilitating and enhancing women's self-observations. The sympto.org system offers an output of the information that the woman has previously entered. She fully takes charge of her input. She also can and sometimes has to change past values according to the STM principles and practice  but she endorses full responsibility for her modifications.  Scientific records  The symptothermal laws describe the biological processes of the female cycle and are explained our Manuals and in any symptothermal guide. The principle of cross-checking at the beginning and the end of the fertility span are based on the internationally recognized German and Austrian NFP/INER schools. The double system of internal and external cervical fluid observation is inspired by A Couple's Guide to Fertility  The Complete Symptothermal Method  Rose Fuller and Rev. J. Huneger  Northwest Family Services  Portland  Oregon. (This book is the American extension of the INER approach developed by J. Rötzer.) The option allowing the user to focus either on the temperature signs only or on the cervical fluid observations (Billings mode) is an innovation of our Foundation  as is the interchangeability of the vaginal sensation level and the cervix examination. We also have reformulated the symptothermal laws in our Manuals and introduced into sympto educational tools for beginners (motivation messages  daily recommendations  error messages). The entry board for the daily observations as well as the design of cycle charts are our copyright.  When used correctly  the sympto fertility indicator will not display 'false negative' results. This means that the system does not display 'infertile' when the cycle is still in its fertility window  according to the symptothermal standards. 'Correct use' means that the observation quality of the woman has been validated out of at least 6 cycles on sympto: either she has introduced 6 of her former cycles when opening an account (which are checked by the sympto administration) or by 6 new learning cycles  monitored by a sympto counsellor. Thus  the risk of an unwanted pregnancy is eliminated. sympto application is very close to the perfect 'classic' use  i.e. comparable to the competent and conscientious manual user. However  sympto displays false positive results in the beginning of the cycle just like the classic NFP use. This means that for the sake of effectiveness  it declares certain days as fertile which in fact are not. The number of false positive days will decrease after 12 cycles of observation  again according to the German NFP-standards. It is however possible that sympto might not be able to detect all temperature rise scenarios  especially if they are exceptional and complicated. These exceptions will generate more false positive days within the cycle.
