Legal information   Index   Copyright © UNICEF   Information disclosure policy  Linking to UNICEF  Note on maps   Privacy policy  Terms of use   UNICEF cookies policy     Privacy policy Your privacy on the Internet is of utmost importance to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  This privacy statement describes UNICEF’s policy concerning the gathering and sharing of visitors’ information through the UNICEF web site.  It applies to all “UNICEF sites” – that is  all sites within the “unicef.org” domain name.  You should note that through this site you may reach or be directed to other sites that relate to UNICEF  such as http://www.supportunicef.org/ or the sites of our national committees (the various private charities around the world whose job is to support UNICEF); all these sites have their own privacy statements which are similar to this one but may vary slightly.  By visiting the UNICEF website you are accepting the practices described in this policy. What information does UNICEF collect? Normal website usage  In general  you can browse the UNICEF site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs.  These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address  domain name  browser type  operating system  and information such as the web site that referred you to us  the files you downloaded  the pages you visit  and the dates/times of those visits. Collection of personally identifiable information  If you register for a newsletter  log on to certain UNICEF sites  order a book or other merchandise  request information  provide feedback  apply for a job  join a discussion group or join an electronic mailing list  you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name  postal address and e-mail address.  This information is collected only with your knowledge and permission  and is kept in various UNICEF databases.  If you are purchasing something on the web  you may be asked to provide your credit card details. UNICEF sites with specific requirements to collect personal information may publish a privacy policy specific for that site.  In these cases  the site-specific policies will be complementary to this general UNICEF privacy policy  but will give additional details for that particular use. UNICEF’s websites use cookies to provide statistics that help us to give you the best experience of our sites. You can find out more in our cookies policy page or switch them off if you prefer.  However  by continuing to use our sites without changing settings  you are agreeing to our use of cookies. Joining electronic discussion groups may mean that other participants of the discussion group (including non-UNICEF employees) will see personal information that you have volunteered.  For open discussion groups  this information will be public. Special note about information from children  Several sites in the UNICEF domain are focused on children  including interactive sites such as group discussions.  Some of these require user-specific information to be provided to UNICEF.  We ask for the minimum amount of personal information in this case. These parts of the UNICEF site are for children and authorized adults only and unauthorized adults are not to participate in these parts of the UNICEF site.  (Obtaining user information helps us in that regard if needed.) Children should make sure their parents  or the adults who are caring for them  know they are participating in the UNICEF sites and are providing this limited user information. What does UNICEF do with the information it collects? Normal web usage  The information gathered during general browsing of the “unicef.org” domain is used to analyse trends and usage of the UNICEF site and to improve the usefulness of the site.  It is not connected with any personal information.  However  if you have registered with UNICEF in connection with any activity on the UNICEF site  the information we collect about your normal web usage will be identifiable to you. Personally identifiable information  UNICEF may use the personal information you provide to:  Contact you – either in response to a query or suggestion  or to mail newsletters  documents  publications  etc. to you  and we also may provide the information to the UNICEF national committees so they can contact you as well;  Manage and process your job application;  Confirm your purchases and registrations on the site;  Obtain payment for purchases through the site (via credit card);  “Remember” your online profile and preferences;  Help you quickly find information that is relevant to you based on your interests  and help us create site contents most relevant to you;  Undertake statistical analysis.  What if I don’t want to provide personal information?  Providing personal information on the UNICEF web site is optional.  If you choose not to provide personal information  you can still browse and use the UNICEF site  but you will not be able to carry out certain actions such as purchasing items  registering for a newsletter  or applying for a job. Opting out and changing your information  At any time  you can cancel or modify your information by returning to the web page where you first provided the information and contacting the focal point for that page/relevant UNICEF department.  Where contact details are not provided on the page  you can contact us for further information. Security  We do not sell or share any personally identifiable information volunteered on the UNICEF site to any third party without prior consent.  We do  however  share some user information with our national committees so that the whole UNICEF family can respond to your needs.  Any information provided to UNICEF by users of the UNICEF site is held with the utmost care and security  and will not be used in ways other than as set forth in this privacy policy  or in any site-specific policies  or in ways to which you have explicitly consented.  UNICEF employs a range of techniques and security measures to protect the information maintained on our system from loss  misuse  unauthorised access or disclosure  alteration  or destruction. However  UNICEF assumes no responsibility for the security of information.  The UNICEF site contains link to sites external to the unicef.org domain.  UNICEF is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.
