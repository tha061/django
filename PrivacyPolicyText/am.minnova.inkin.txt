(“inKin” “we” “us” or “our” )  along with the Terms of Service   the Privacy Policy   and  as applicable  any Order Form or other Business Platform Subscriber-specific supplement entered into between you and inKin  shall together constitute the terms and conditions governing inKin’s provision of  and your access to and use of the products  applications  services  content  resources  information  materials  features and functionality accessible on or through inKin’s Business Wellness Platform (the “Business Platform”) (collectively  the “Premium Services”).  Your Subscription and Authorized Users  In purchasing a subscription to the Business Services and creating a Business Platform  you are encouraging health and wellness and building comradery among those individuals you invite to become members of your Business Platform by providing them with a unique space where they can connect  track their fitness progress and compete against each other in fitness challenges.  After you create an inKin Business Platform by visiting https://www.inkin.com/corporate-wellness/   you may invite individuals to join your Free or Business Platform.  Those individuals who accept your invitation  create an inKin account and join your Free or Business Platform (the “Authorized Users”) will then have access to the Premium Services  and their access to such services is governed by the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy .  inKin’s Provision of the Business Services  Your subscription to use the Business Services grants you access to features not available on our free Social Fitness Platform and Free Wellness Platform  such as the ability to run and participate in team battle contests and view your team’s overall fitness and health performance statistics  Tags  etc.  plus Business Platform Subscribers receive priority technical support.  inKin will make the Business Services available to you and your Authorized Users and will not materially decrease functionality of the Business Services throughout your subscription term.  inKin will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Business Services available 24 hours a day  7 days a week  excluding planned downtime.  Business Platform Subscriber’s Rights and Obligations With Respect to its Authorized Users  You may control your Authorized Users’ access to and use of the Free or Business Wellness Platforms.  For example  inKin provides you with the capability to provision or deprovision access to the Business Services  enable or disable third party integrations  manage permissions  retention and export settings  create contests  tags  download statistics  access individual statistics  appoint admins  and transfer or assign teams.  If you have any internal policies or practices that are relevant to the Authorized Users’ use of the Business Services (e.g. a Company code of conduct)  you agree to inform the Authorized Users of such policies and practices and you agree that inKin bears no responsibility or liability in connection with an Authorized User’s failure to comply with such policies or practices.   You agree to obtain all rights  permissions or consents from your Authorized Users or other parties that are necessary  for you and your Authorized Users to use the Free or Business Services in compliance with this Agreement  the Terms of Service   the Privacy Policy   and  as applicable  any Order Form or other supplement entered into between you and inKin.  Subscription Term; Pricing and Payment  Current and specific information regarding pricing can be found on the inKin website  however  below please find an overview the pricing structure for our Business Services.  We charge you a price for a selected “Fixed Term” per “Account”  You have the option of selecting a Fixed Term of one month  three months  or one year.  Generally the longer the Fixed Term you select  the lower the price will be for month day per Account.  Any Authorized User  meaning any individual who at your invitation has joined your Platform (Free or Business)  and any individual who has a current invitation from you to join your Platform  is a User Account.  Our pricing for a Business Platform is thus structured on a per User Account basis under which you pay a certain fee per Fixed Term depending on how many User Accounts are allowed to be in use through your Business Platform. Stated another way  the fee you pay per User Account per month is based on two factors: (i) the number of User Accounts on your Platform and (ii) your selected Fixed Term.  The number of inKin User Accounts on your Business Platform is calculated by adding (i) the number of Authorized Users on your Business Platform (each of whom is an individual who has accepted your invitation to join your Business Platform and has created an inKin User Account)  (ii) the number of pending invitations to join your Business Platform (meaning  invitations you have sent out which have not yet been accepted) and (iii) the number of pending requests to join your Business Platform (meaning  requests Users have sent you for your approval).  You have the ability to revoke invitations or decline the pending requests before proceeding with payment if you do not feel comfortable paying for invites and requests.  With respect to Fixed Terms  you may select from among one-month  three-month  or twelve-month Fixed Terms.  These Fixed Terms for your subscriptions correspond to the frequency with which you are billed for the Business Services.  All fees must be paid in advance  so for example  if you select a three-month Fixed Term  you will be billed quarterlly and will be required to pay upfront for your three-month subscription Fixed Term.   inKin may offer promotions such as free months to incentivize its Business Platform Subscribers to select longer Fixed Terms or discounts.  Finally  inKin offers a one-time 7-day free trial period  which allows you to try out the Business Services at no cost to you! When you start your trial  we give you access to our Business Services for 7 days for free with no strings attached. Once your trial is over  you may either continue using the Business Services and update your billing info or downgrade to our forever Free option.  When additional people are invited to join your Business Platform during a given Fixed Term  you will pay for the new User Accounts proportionally based on the time left in your subscription term.  For example  if you have a three-month Fixed Term with 30 Authorized Users  and then you invite 25 new User Accounts to join with one month left in your Fixed Term  you will pay for those 25 new User Accounts only for the rateable amount per User Account for the one remaining month of your Fixed Term.  However  if the new User Accounts you accrue during a Fixed Term push you over a threshold where you would have been eligible for a lower per-User Account price  you will then obtain the benefit of that lower per-User Account price for those additional User Accounts only  for the remainder of the Fixed Term.  Payment obligations are non-cancelable and  except as expressly stated herein or in an applicable Order Form between you and inKin  fees paid are non-refundable . If we agree to invoice by email  full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes  levies  duties  or similar governmental assessments of any nature  including  for example  value-added  sales  use or withholding taxes  assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively  “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases  except for those taxes based on our net income.  To avoid any interruption in our service  the automatic charges are made one day before your next billing period. All transactions displayed are in the GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) zone . For example  if your next billing period starts on November 22  then the payment will go through on November 21 GMT.  Please note that deleting your personal account you created a wellness platform with does not automatically remove the platform. The platform must be managed separately. Deleting your personal account you have created the platform with does not waive your responsibility of managing your subscription.  Any credits  discounts or promotions that may accrue to your “Business Platform Account” (meaning  the account we create at the Business Platform level for all of your User Accounts) will expire upon the expiration or termination of your Business  Platform Account  will have no currency or exchange value and will not be transferable or refundable.  If any fees owed to inKin by you (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are fourteen (14) days or more overdue  inKin may  without limiting our other rights and remedies  downgrade your Business  Services to free plans or limit use of your Business  Platform until those amounts are paid in full. You acknowledge and agree that a downgrade will result in a decrease in certain features and functionality and potential loss of access to your account data.  Termination  Auto-Renewal: Unless an applicable Order Form between you and inKin provides otherwise  (i) your subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each subscription term for another term of equal length to that of the immediately preceding Fixed Term (month  three months  or twelve month); and (ii) the per User Account pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the term immediately preceding the renewal term  excluding any promotions.  A Party must give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscription from automatically renewing (except where a Business Subscriber has a one-month Fixed Term  in which case either Party must give fourteen (14) days notice of non-renewal).  You may opt to make changes to your subscription plan during a subscription term  in which case the changes will apply to the next subscription term. If you voluntarily cancel your subscription  you may reactivate it at any time.  Termination for Cause: Either Party may terminate your subscription on notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches its obligations under this Agreement  the Terms of Service   the Privacy Policy   or  as applicable  any Order Form or other supplement entered into between you and inKin  and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching Party provides notice of the breach. You are responsible for your Authorized Users  including for any breaches caused by your Authorized Users. We may terminate your subscription immediately on notice to you if we reasonably believe that you or your Authorized Users are using the Premium Services in violation of applicable law.  Effect of Termination: Upon any termination by you for cause  we will refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the subscription term as of the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by us  you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of your subscription term.  In no event will any termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

No waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party being deemed to have granted the waiver.  Severability: In the event that any portion of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason  such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other portion of this Agreement  which shall remain in full force and effect and be construed as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not part of this Agreement  Assignment: Neither Party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder  whether by operation of law or otherwise  without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).  Any purported assignment in violation of this section is void    This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
