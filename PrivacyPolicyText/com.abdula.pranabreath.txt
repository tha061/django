So even if people in black came and asked nicely to see your data  we wouldn't have anything to show them.  There are no in-app tricky analytical plug-ins: literally  we don't have any access to your cookies  other apps  e-mail  and any other things used for fishing. It's just no fun!  Purchasing the app or the subscription  you are interacting with Google Billing API  according to its privacy policy; personally we have no access to your credit card number  name or address.  Actually  all that we do have is the info provided by Play Developer Console and its built-in Google Analytics  that is some general data like the app's Play Market page traffic and users' demography. And we don't tell it to any interested third parties  plus they have no interest in it.
