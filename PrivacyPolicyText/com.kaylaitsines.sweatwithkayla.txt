That personal data is collected and processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Data Controller  “Bikini Body” (referred to as “we”  “us”  “our” or “Bikini Body”) in this policy primarily refers to The Bikini Body Training Company Pty Ltd  the main operating company of the Bikini Body group  and  where appropriate  to other companies in the Bikini Body group or other entities over which Bikini Body exercises management control. Bikini Body is the “data controller” of all personal data that is collected and used about Bikini Body customers for the purposes of privacy and data protection laws  principles and regulations which may apply in your country.    What personal data we collect  Personal data means any information relating to you which allows us to identify you  such as your name  phone number  social media name or ‘handle’  postal address  email address  details of products or services you have purchased  payment details and information about your access to our website.  We may collect personal data from you (either directly or indirectly  through our third party partners or providers) in a number of ways.

Personal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” personal data under applicable data protection laws. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent  or it is necessary (for instance if you request special assistance)  or you have deliberately made it public.    What do we use your personal data for  why  and for how long  Your data may be used for the following purposes:   Provide products and services you request: we use the information you give us to perform the services for which you have signed up;  Credit or other payment card verification/screening; and payment information for accounting  billing and audit purposes and to detect or prevent any fraudulent activities;  Administrative or legal purposes: we use your data for statistical and marketing analysis  systems testing  customer surveys  maintenance and development  or in order to deal with a dispute or claim. We may perform data profiling based on the data we collect from you for statistical and marketing analysis purposes  but only with your prior consent  and by making best endeavours to ensure that all data it is based on is accurate. By providing any personal data you explicitly agree that we may use it to perform profiling activities in accordance with this privacy policy;  Security  health  administrative  crime prevention/detection: we may pass your information to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements;  Customer service communications: we use your data to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to improve our services and enhance your experience with us;  Provide tailored services: we use your data to provide information we believe is of interest to you  prior to  during  and after your interactions with us  and to personalise the services we offer to you  such as special offers.   We will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so  which will depend on the reasons for which we have collected and need to use your personal data.  In most cases we will need to process your personal data so that we can enter into our contract and fulfil the provision or delivery of goods or services to you.  We may also process your personal data for one or more of the following:   To comply with a legal obligation;  Where you have consented to our using your personal data (eg. for marketing related uses);  To protect your vital interests or those of another person (eg. in case of a medical emergency);  If it is in our legitimate interests to do so (eg. for administrative purposes).   Only children above a certain age (generally 16 years or older  but varying from country to country) can provide their own consent. For children under this age  the knowledge and consent of the parents or legal guardians is required.  We will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period  we consider the amount  nature and sensitivity of the personal data  the purposes for which we process it  and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.  We also consider the periods for which we might need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal obligations  or to deal with complaints and queries  and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.  When we no longer need your personal data  we will securely delete or destroy it. We will also consider if and how we can minimise over time the personal data that we use  and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you  in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.    Security of your personal data  We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data  and to protect it against accidental loss  destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the Internet.

We may also share your personal data with the following third parties for the purpose described in this privacy policy:   Government authorities  law enforcement bodies and regulators for compliance with legal requirements;  Other companies  contractors or agents to provide services to you including delivery  marketing  support ticket providers (which may include Zendesk)  or marketing platform providers (which may include Emarsys)  communications  legal services  debt collection  administration services  customer services  information technology providers  credit card or other payment methods to conduct transactions;  The host of our online store (Shopify Inc.)  which provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.

If we do ask for your personal information for a secondary purpose such as marketing and you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA)  we will either ask you directly for your express consent  or provide you with an opportunity to say no. If after you opt-in  you change your mind  you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you for the continued collection  use or disclosure of your information  at any time  by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link within any of our emails. If you are outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)  you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you for the continued collection  use or disclosure of your information  at any time  by contacting us or by using the unsubscribe link within any of our emails.  We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of websites. This software does not enable us to capture any of your data.  Your personal information will not be shared  sold  rented or disclosed other than as described in this privacy policy.    Data Protection Officer  We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee compliance with this policy. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority. The data protection supervisory authority for you depends upon the country or geographical area in which you are located.    Your Data Protection Rights  Under certain circumstances  by law you have the right to:   Request information about whether we hold personal information about you  and  if so  what that information is and why we are holding/using it.  Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.  Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.  Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see e. below).  Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.  Object to automated decision-making including profiling  that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.  Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you  for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.  Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.  Withdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection  processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose  you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent  we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed  unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.   If you want to exercise any of these rights  then please contact our DPO by email at dataprotection@sweat.com . Alternatively  if you are an Australian resident you can also contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at the same email address: dataprotection@sweat.com .  You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However  we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive. Alternatively  we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.    Changes to Privacy Policy  Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to you by way of an e-mail or a notice on our website.     Get Your Free Workout And Nutrition Tips Now!
