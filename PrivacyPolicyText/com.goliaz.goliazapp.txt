Data collection  processing and use within Goliaz ecosystem   General Use To use our Goliaz App or advanced website features  you must have a Goliaz account. You have already found out above what data are collected for this purpose. To provide you with the best Goliaz experience possible  our approach is partly based on publishing specific information of our users  i.e. even your information.         This introduction includes the following information  in particular:  public profile (photo  name  surname  training location  motivation)  condition (estimated fitness level  desired objective)  training information (period and type of training  total number of training sessions  photo)  followed by/follows (person who follows the user  person followed by the user)   You become visible in Goliaz App with the data in your public profile. This information helps other users to find you in Goliaz App. At the same time  other users can see your name and surname (if provided)  your published workouts  and your profile photo  and they can recognise you by this information  if necessary.  Goliaz app will save all your successfully completed workouts  as well as related information  such as self-uploaded photos or comments.  Other users can see these data and can consider them as incentive for themselves  leave comments or decide whether they want to follow you.  Moreover  our app also provides the users with the possibility to be followed (Followed by) to support or encourage them in their training experience  or to compete with one another. For this purpose  users can be searched for by the name registered in the public profile  and if connected to your Facebook profile  your friends will be presented to you via suggestions.  You will be notified about new followers on the website or mobile App by push message. Thus  some of your information is also available to other users in Goliaz App  irrespective of whether it is accessed on the website or in the relevant mobile Apps.  If you do not want to make it possible to link your performance to yourself  you are free to refrain from providing any personal data on your profile or training sessions and linking your account to Facebook. Moreover  you should not save any training photos.  For this reason  we have ensured that each user can change their personal information which can be viewed by other users and each user is free to use their own name or a fictitious name.  Goliaz Personal Trainer  Personalised training  If you opted for Goliaz Premium  you will receive a full customized training program  renewable weekly by you and based on your fitness level and goals.

We process this entry to generate training for our users  taking into account the limitation.
