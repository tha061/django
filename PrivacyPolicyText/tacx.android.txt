When making the connection the Software sends a scope to the OAuth2 provider in question which contains all the information it requests. The scope is as follows: • Facebook: email and public profile. • Google: email and profile. • Strava: write  full reading and writing rights to Strava account of the user.

These data are provided by the Software or account backends. Further data required by these templates is generated by either the account backend or the Software backend. The actual content as it is sent to the user is stored in Mandrill for later reference. In the future  new types of email may require other use of data  logically this data will be provided by the account backend or the Software backend from their storage systems.
