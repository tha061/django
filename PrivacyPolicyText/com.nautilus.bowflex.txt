You can choose not to provide certain information  but then you might not be able to participate in our surveys or incentives  purchase products  or take advantage of certain features of the Service.  If you engage with us through a social media platform those communications are governed by this Privacy Policy as well as the policy of the relevant social media platform.  You may choose to provide us names or other contact information for a friend to take advantage of a referral or other program  to send them product information or gifts  or to utilize a social feature of the Service.

We value your reviews  comments  feedback  testimonials  etc.  which help us improve our services and products. By making such submissions to us  you assign your rights in the submissions to us as described in the Submissions section of our Terms of Use page.  INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE  We and our business partners receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example  like many Web sites  we use technologies such as cookies and clear gifs to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses one of our Sites  or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys  participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives  or open or respond to any newsletter or other e-mail. We may also allow our business partners  including ad networks  to use these technologies to serve advertisements  provide other advertising services and/or collect certain information when you visit the Sites or utilize the Service. For more information about regarding third party marketers and business partners please see the THIRD PARTY MARKETERS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS section of this Privacy Policy below.  Briefly  cookies are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you  such as recognizing you as an existing customer or previous Site visitor. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier  similar in function to cookies  and may be used to track the online movements of Web users or to let us know if you have opened an e-mail that we sent you.  Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version  operating system  and platform; your behavior on the Sites and related services  including the products you view or searched for  as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on the Sites or not).  You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits  although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on  and significant portions of  the Sites. Also  because information we obtain may be combined  we may still be able to identify your web browser  computer or mobile device when you access the Service even if you disable cookies. Some browsers incorporate a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) feature that  when turned on  signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals  we do not currently respond to them. For more information about the use of cookies and how to block them  visit www.allaboutcookies.org  www.youronlinechoices.eu (Europe) or www.aboutads.info/choices (United States).  We may use  or permit our business partners to use  other technologies similar to cookies for the same purposes as we may use cookies  including to collect and analyze information regarding your use of our mobile  desktop and device applications. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies  and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.
