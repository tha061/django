What & Why We do not directly collect or store your email address and name - the only exception is when you authenticate yourself to send App Invites for unlocking content (read App Invites section below). However  we do use third party analytics and crash reporting services (like Google Analytics) to allow us to better understand and improve the functionality of our app on your device. These may collect data about your interactions with the app - such as how often you use the application  the events that occur within the application  aggregated usage  performance data  and where the application was downloaded from  things like device OS and IP address etc. On our websites too  we use third party analytics service which collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available  such as the browser type  language preference  referring site  and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the site.
