The Rocket Science Group LLC is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement  which provides a guarantee to comply with European data protection standards ( https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&status=Active ). The shipping service provider is based on our legitimate interests acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO and a contract processing agreement acc. Art. 28 (3) sentence 1 DSGVO.  The shipping service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form  i. without assignment to a user  to optimize or improve their own services  e.g. for the technical optimization of shipping and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes. However  the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.  2.13 NEWSLETTER – SUCCESS MEASUREMENT  The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”  i. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when opening the newsletter from our server  or if we use a shipping service provider. This call will initially collect technical information  such as information about the browser and your system  as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.  This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits  based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened  when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons  this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However  it is neither our goal nor  if used  that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.  2.14 GOOGLE ANALYTICS  Based on our legitimate interests (i.e.  interest in the analysis  optimization  and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO)  Google Analytics uses a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.  The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f DSGVO. As a guarantee in accordance with Art. 44ff DSGVO  Google has signed the EU standard contractual clauses.  Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users  to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case  pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.  We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.  The IP address submitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to its use of the online offer and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en .

DSGVO) we use the marketing and remarketing services (“Google Marketing Services “)  LLC  1600 Amphitheater Parkway  Mountain View  CA 94043  USA  (” Google “).  The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f DSGVO. As a guarantee in accordance with Art. 44ff DSGVO  Google has signed the EU standard contractual clauses.  Google Marketing Services allows us to better target advertisements for and on our website so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. If a user e.g. is shown ads for products he’s been interested in on other websites is called remarketing. For these purposes  when Google and our other websites accessing Google Marketing Services are directly accessed by Google  a code will be executed by Google and so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code  also called “Web Beacons “) incorporated into the website. With their help  the user is provided with an individual cookie  i. a small file is saved (instead of cookies  comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by different domains  including google.com   doubleclick.net   invitemedia.com   admeld.com   googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com . In this file is noted which web pages the user visited  for what content he is interested and what offers he has clicked  as well as technical information about the browser and operating system  referring web pages  visit time and other information on the use of the online offer. The IP address of the users is also recorded  whereby in the context of Google Analytics we announce that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases to one Google server in the US is transmitted and shortened there. The IP address will not be merged with data of the user within other offers from Google. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites  they can be displayed according to his interests  the ads tailored to him.  The data of the users are pseudonym processed in the context of the Google marketing services. That Google stores and processes e.g. not the name or e-mail address of the users  but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. That means from the perspective of Google  the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person  but to the cookie owner  regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the United States.  Among the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program “Google AdWords”. In the case of Google AdWords  each advertiser receives a different “conversion cookie”. Cookies can not be tracked through AdWords advertisers’ websites. The information collected through the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However  they do not receive information that personally identifies users.  We can incorporate third-party ads based on the Google AdSense marketing service. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its affiliate sites to serve ads based on users’ visits to this site or other sites on the Internet.  In addition  we may use the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage the Google Analytics and Marketing Services on our website.  For more information about Google’s data usage for marketing  see the overview page: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads   Google’s Privacy Policy located at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy available.

With the help of the Facebook pixel  it is on the one hand possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called “Facebook ads”).

BodyFast app  3.1 Collection of personal data when using the mobile BodyFast app  a) For the use of the BodyFast app no registration is necessary. Just use the function “anonymous login”. Your data will be stored anonymously and without direct personal links (such as e-mail or name).  If you decide to register for Facebook (Facebook Inc.  1601 South California Ave.  Palo Alto  CA 94304  USA  “Facebook”)  we will receive the following personal information:   First and Last Name  E-mail address  Gender  Date of birth  Profile picture  Friends list (this can be deselected under the link “edit”)   If you decide to register by e-mail  we will receive the following personal data:   E-mail address   All data that you send to us from login or login (eg e-mail address  profile information) will be transmitted in encrypted form. This encryption protects the confidentiality of the data exchange between your computer and our web server and helps  e.g. to prevent the interception of data. As encryption technology we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  With regard to our databases  all technical precautions have been taken to store your data in a secure environment. Access to the entirety of your information is reserved only for employees who need to complete their professional activities and is only granted for quality control  complaint review and fraud prevention purposes. All our employees are required to comply with data protection regulations and instructed accordingly.

This data collection is carried out by the respective app stores. We have no influence and are not responsible. We only process the data as far as necessary to download the mobile app to your mobile device.  c) If you want to use the mobile app  we also collect the following data that is technically necessary for us to offer you the features of our mobile app and to ensure the stability and security (legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO):   IP address of your mobile device;  Type and version of your mobile device (for example  “iPhone 6  iOS 8.1”)  Date and time of the request;  Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT);  Content of the request (concrete page);  Access status / HTTP status code (file transfer  file not found etc.);  Each transmitted amount of data;  Filename of the requested file  Operating system of the device used and its surface;  Language and region settings of the device  Screen resolution  CPU brand  CPU model  screen size and screen density of the device  RAM memory of the device  Version of the app   After the end of the usage process  this data will be stored anonymously  this means without your IP address  stored in so-called log files. These log files are evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes  a disclosure to third parties does not occur.  d) We use advertising identifiers in the app based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis  optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO). For advertising purposes  we use the so-called “Advertising Identifier” on iOS devices  and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices (collectively “Identifier”). This identifier is a unique but non-personalized and non-permanent identification number for a particular device provided by iOS or Android. The data collected via the identifier will not be linked to any other device-related information. We use the identifier to provide you with personalized advertising and to evaluate your use. If you have ad tracking in the settings of your operating system (in iOS under “Privacy” – “Advertising” the option “no ad-tracking”  under Android “Settings” -> “Google Settings” -> “Google” -> View “->” Disable Personalized Advertising “)  we can do the following:   Measure your interaction with banners by counting the number of ads on a banner without clicking on them (“frequency capping”)   CTR   Determination of unique use (“unique user”)  Safety measures   Prevention of fraud   Troubleshooting.   You can always delete the identifier in the device settings (in iOS “Reset ID”); then a new identifier is created  which is not merged with the previously collected data. We point out that you may not be able to use all the features of our app if you restrict the use of the identifier.  e) You can subscribe to our e-mail newsletter within the app using the Double-Opt-in procedure. Please read the sections “Newsletter”  “Success Measurement Newsletter” and “Newsletter Shipping Service Provider” above on of this page.  3.2 Apple Health Kit  We use Apple’s HealthKit framework (Apple Inc.  1 Infinite Loop  Cupertino  CA 95014  USA  “Apple”)  which provides a central location for health and fitness data on the iPhone and the Apple Watch and with explicit consent allows apps to communicate with the HealthKit Store to access and share this information.  With your explicit consent  we process your health data (weight  body size  age  height  if any) obtained through the HealthKit framework to track and display your fasting activities.  If you enable the HealthKit framework in your iPhone’s settings  BodyFast may  with your consent  send the health information (weight  body size  age  height) to Apple so you can track and view your fasting activities.  The HealthKit framework can be added to new data attributes that are mapped in the product  and you need to agree. At any time  you can prevent Apple from accessing your data and preventing it from being shared by changing your mobile device’s settings. More information about the HealthKit can be found here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit.  3.3 Push notifications  We use push notifications within the app based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis  optimization and economic operation of our online offer as defined in Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO). The app can inform you by push message on certain news  even if you are currently not actively using the app or have it opened. The app uses these push messages only if you have them enabled in the operating system.  When you enable the push message service  your device will be assigned a so-called device token from Apple or a Google Registration ID. Purpose of their use of these IDs is solely the provision of the push services. Without a device token or registration ID  you will not be able to receive push notifications for technical reasons. These identifiers are only encrypted  randomly generated numbers. A conclusion to individual users is excluded for us.  Notes for Apple users:  To be notified of specific events and topics by push notifications  even if you are not currently using the app  you must grant the app the required permission. Without your consent  which you give by activating in the settings  we can not send you a push message. You can customize the permissions for push notifications in iOS settings  and turn push messages on or off at any later time.  To do this  open the app settings for iOS and select the menu item “Notifications”. The following menu provides an overview of all the apps installed on your device that have a push notification feature. Choos our app here. Here you can switch the push notification function on or off. In addition  you have the option to customize the appearance of push notifications of the app to your liking.  Notes for Android users:  On Android  all apps are set by default to allow you to receive push notifications  even if you have not opened or used the app. This can not be avoided due to the technical specifications of Google  on which we have no influence.  Within the app  you can switch off the push services you activated (more -> messages) at any time. Regardless of the settings in the app  you can also switch off the reception of push notifications by going to the App Settings “in the main menu of your device and selecting” Apps “in the following menu item. There you will find an overview of all the apps installed on your device. Choose here our app. You can then switch the push message function on or off using the “Show notifications” check mark.  3.4 Google Firebase  A) BASICS  Based on our legitimate interests (i.e.  interest in the analysis  optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit.
