Gift Cards Members Area About #CrockFitTshirt Transformations Contact FAQ Blog  #Crockfit Privacy policy My Personal statement before the too technical information  Hi  Privacy is something I respect and appreciate as my world  and daily routine is so public due to nature of my business and job. I like to keep many things private and would like companies and services I use to keep my details closed  and I don't want any businesses to contact me without my consent. I had to learn very quickly about GDPR  as I knew it starts from May 25th  2018. What I discovered is a lot but a simple summary is this  the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced to unify the whole of Europe's approach to data regulation  ensuring all data protection laws are applied equally to every country within the EU. It will protect EU citizens from their data being used irresponsibly and puts them in charge of what's shared  where and how. We at #CrockFit take your privacy very seriously  and we can assure you’re your details are safe with us but to ease your mind  we have created the below privacy policies we at #CrockFit follow and I have kept this hopefully reasonably understandable and straightforward. I hope you read and understand these privacy policies as it is crucial you understand the right you have over your personal data.
