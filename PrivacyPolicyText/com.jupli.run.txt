 Just one person making apps for fun!  Just Run Privacy Policy  I know you don't want to read a long and boring privacy policy  so I'll keep it short!  Jupli is a trading name of Syncostyle Limited  86-90 Paul Street  London EC2A 4NE  United Kingdom. Sounds complicated  but the company is just one person (me!). The reason for the different names is that after I set up the company  I thought Jupli sounded cooler! Anyway  from here on  I means Syncostyle Limited!  What data does the app collect?  Countly Analytics is used in the app to track some user interactions  installation stats and device info. Some example interactions are changing trainer  or selecting a workout plan - though this isn't an exhaustive list. All this data is anonymous  and absolutely no personal information is collected.  How is the data used?  All the interactions tracked go into Jupli's private Countly server. Only I have access to the account with this data and I will not share these details with any third party. I mainly use the data to determine how many people are using the app day to day  and which devices are most popular (so I know where to focus my work).
