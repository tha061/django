You do not need to create any online account to use the app  so you wont even be asked to enter your real name  password or any such sensitive Information. Certain features in our apps such as exporting data between two of our own apps (from pedometer to calorie counter for example) or between the free and the pro version of a certain app  requires us to ask the system if our other app we are trying to send data to is installed or not. The system might query all apps in order to give us the answer. We do not however collect/save/share the names or info of other third party apps installed on your device. We only receive a yes or no answer from the system about the existence of our app. When you enter your weight/age/gender/etc in some of the apps such as calorie counter  it is only used in order for the app to function properly (for example to calculate your daily calorie intake)  These will only be stored locally on your phone and can be removed when you clear the app data. We do not share this information with any third party. In order to be able to offer the free versions of our Apps  we show non-intrusive ads provided by several ad companies (Google Admob  AdFalcon  Verizon  AdColony  AppLovin  Amazon  Mopub). Some companies such as google Admob need to place mobile identifiers in order to deliver ads and combat fraud. Ad companies may use google Advertising ID (in a pseudonymous manner) to deliver relevant ads to users as well as IP-Address for ad delivery. To see the list of ad technology providers working with google Admob as well as the links to the privacy policy of all the ad networks we work with  scroll down to the end. In order for us to comply with EU regulations  EU users need to explicitly consent to the use of this data as well as being older than 16 by clicking the \”I Agree\” button below. You have the right to the deletion of any kind of data. In our apps its all saved locally on your phone. So to delete your data  simply go to phone setting  find the app and click the clear data option. This will also delete your app settings and tweaks  make sure to export your lists in certain apps (like custom food lists) before doing this so you can import them later. You also have the right to request data deletion from any ad network we work with by going to the links provided below and requesting that directly from them. If you wish to withdraw your consent as an EU user and opt out of relevant ads  you can freely do so in several ways. You can use the other option we provide of removing all ads by purchasing the pro version of the said app. You can use the opt-out setting in your phone by opening the google ad settings app in your phone and using the option \”opt out of interest based ads\”. You can use the opt-out setting provided by each ad company themselves in their own privacy policy (see links below). You can Refrain from using the free version of the said app. Regardless of the case  the advertising ID/IP Address will NOT be used by us (not possible anyway) or by advertising companies to directly personally identify you. Its only about showing interest-based ads.
