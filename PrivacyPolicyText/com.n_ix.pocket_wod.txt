DoubleClick DART Cookie  What is the DoubleClick cookie doing on my computer? If you have a DoubleClick cookie in your Cookies folder  it is most likely a DART cookie. The DoubleClick DART cookie helps marketers learn how well their Internet advertising campaigns or paid search listings perform. Many marketers and Internet websites use DoubleClick’s DART technology to deliver and serve their advertisements or manage their paid search listings. DoubleClick’s DART products set or recognize a unique  persistent cookie when an ad is displayed or a paid listing is selected. The information that the DART cookie helps to give marketers includes the number of unique users their advertisements were displayed to  how many users clicked on their Internet ads or paid listings  and which ads or paid listings they clicked on.  Why does your cookie keep coming back after I delete it? When you visit any website or search engine on which DoubleClick’s DART technology is used  our servers will check to see if you already have a DART cookie. If the servers do not receive a DART cookie  the servers will try to set a cookie in response to your browser’s “request” to view that Web page. If you do not want a DART cookie with a unique value  you can obtain a DoubleClick DART “opt out” cookie. Alternatively  you can adjust your Internet browser’s settings for handling cookies. This is explained in the next question.  How can I adjust my cookie settings to accept or decline cookies?

Select “Override automatic cookie handling” and choose whether you want to accept  block or be prompted for “First-party” and “Third-party Cookies.” If you want to block all cookies coming from DoubleClick’s doubleclick.net domain  go to the “Web Sites” section under the “Privacy” tab and click the “Edit” button. In the “Address of Web site” field  enter “doubleclick.net ” select “Block ” click OK (menu will disappear); click OK again and you will be back to the browser.  * If you are using Netscape 6.0+  go to “Edit” in the menu bar  click on “Preferences ” click on “Advanced ” and select the “Cookies” field.
