Paralysis is one of the most disturbing phenomena. When we sleep, large muscle groups are often temporarily paralyzed in order to prevent the physical trauma of the sleeper, when the dreamed images will reflexively cause a physical reaction. This condition may make you worry if you realize that your body is paralyzed, but it is not aware that the mind is still sleeping. A sleeping person in a dream can acutely feel his helplessness and start panicking.
It is believed that a hostile spirit is chaining the person to the bed. According to a more realistic approach, the dream of paralysis is a reflection of the dreamer's spiritual depression.
