From a psychological point of view, the sun is a masculine symbol, which means the conscious mind and the intellect. The sun may symbolize the true self and represent intelligence as distinct from intuition. For example, the sunrise dream may indicate a new beginning, while the sunset dream may indicate the end of the phase. If in a dream you see a scorching and hot sun, this may mean that your intellectual powers dominate the psyche and can destroy your emotional life.
