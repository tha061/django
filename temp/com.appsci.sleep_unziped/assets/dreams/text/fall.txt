Before we achieve anything in life, we often stumble and fall, but then success will definitely come! You just have to learn to take risks in life and not be afraid of any barriers in the form of falls. Fall in a dream may symbolize that you lose control of your life. And if this is true, then you should find that controlled area of your life with which you can gain control over other areas. They say "hit (fall) face in the dirt," "fallen woman" - these expressions can be real symbols. Have you found something familiar to you with this symbolism?
