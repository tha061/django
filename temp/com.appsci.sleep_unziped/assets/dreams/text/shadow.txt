If we consider the interpretation of the dream about the shadow from a psychological point of view, then we can symbolize it as the dark side of your nature. Such a dream symbolizes all that "bad" that you wish not to be. “Shadow” is your dark side, which you refuse to recognize. You are trying to reject this side, but it still is struggling with you, trying to become a leader. These are repressed aspects of the self. You should show these hidden feelings to daylight in order to weaken their power over you, otherwise you will allow your “evil self” to take dominion over you. Think about your behavior, maybe you blame others for your mistakes?!
As for the mystical meaning, we'd like to remember that many superstitions indicate that "shadow" is a part of a person’s soul. Do not step on it or throw anything at it, otherwise, it will harm a person. Be careful if you dreamed it happened to you.
