All people and you, too, are probably afraid of fire, we imagine it as the flame of a dragon from which there is no turning back. If you burn in a dream, it will seem life-threatening and extremely painful to you. If in a dream you burn any object (your favorite), it symbolizes your preference for the thing and that you cannot live without it.
Our beloved Sigmund Freud said that fire symbolizes virility. And according to his opinion we can say that the fire shows that you are trying to cope with the situation and the extent of control over it. If you have a dream in which you successfully cope with the flame, and then in real life keep the situation under control, and vice versa. Perhaps some kind of push should happen in your life that will change everything?
