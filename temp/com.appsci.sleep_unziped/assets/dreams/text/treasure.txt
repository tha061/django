If in a dream you saw a treasure, then perhaps you have a great desire for adventure or you are in search of life wisdom. Also this dream may symbolize your desire to receive money. If you interpret this dream on the one hand, it is likely that in real life, you really have financial problems, but if you look at it from the other side, then it can embody wisdom and experience, the acquisition of which is so desirable for you.
To understand the correct meaning of the dream, you must reflect on what the treasure you are looking for in a dream is. It is possible that instead of looking for money treasure, you are looking for an artifact of historical or cultural significance. If your search was successful, you can get a new understanding of life and interpersonal relationships that are hidden in a dream under the subject of treasure.
However, the scenario of your dream may have a completely different picture - you find the treasure in a completely unexpected place. And in this case, your capabilities are not fully recognized by you. Your subconscious as if prompts you to look for an answer literally under your feet.
