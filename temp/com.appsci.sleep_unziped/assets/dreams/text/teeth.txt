Many people often have dreams about teeth and their loss. These dreams carry an alarming tone, although not as strong as during nightmares. Basically, this problem of teeth in a dream only disturbs the one who dreams, while other actors in sleep either do not notice them at all, or do not attach any importance to this.
In the dream itself, if you lose a tooth, then you will feel awkward while in real life this dream may be interpreted as "losing face in public". You should not take this dream seriously, because basically the loss of teeth can symbolize physical sensations. For example, you have an increased sensitivity or teeth grinding in a dream.
