Water is the source of life. No living creature can exist without water. Regarding dreams, you must understand that water can be both friend and foe, no matter in what form you see it (deep fresh lake, river carrying life, or the ocean that absorbs people). If the dream contains this meaningful symbol in any form, it is extremely important to understand its role.
