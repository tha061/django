Each of us is afraid to face death in a dream. It seems to us very scary and frightening. In a dream, death can come to you in various forms, for example, it may have a sense of death or the realization of your desire. The sensation of death can be both psychological and physical. Physical sensation you can observe in a dream while you are having nightmares. The psychological aspect is an integral part of the fear of impending danger.
If you feel the threat of death in a dream, it may indicate that you doubt about your decisions for which you are not quite ready. It may also be the spiritualistic aspect of death. People who gain extraterrestrial experience often in a dream feel that they cannot return to the body on time. These dreams clearly reveal the influence of the cosmos and spiritual phenomena on our lives.
Most of us see death in a dream as a powerful enemy that should be avoided. We feel very uncomfortable when we look at it. By the way, you should pay attention to how you died in your sleep. Do you blame someone for your death? This is a very important aspect.
If in a dream you observe that someone of your loved ones dies, it may mean that you sincerely care about the well-being of this person and love him. If you see the death of strangers, this may explain the continuation of the transition, and various aspects of your self. Mortal strangers also symbolize stereotypes that should be rethought or studied in order to better understand themselves.
