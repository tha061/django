If in a dream you see a quarrel, it can symbolize the conflict between your spiritual and physical self. Such a dream can be interpreted as a passionate dispute, respectively, you have an extreme feeling.
Another interpretation may imply that a quarrel may indicate that there is a conflict between what we were taught and what we believe or believed in. Such a conflict can only be resolved through emotion. If you have a dream in which you are quarrelling with someone may indicate your inner conflict. For example, if you quarrel with authority, e.g. police, symbolizes a conflict between right and wrong. If a man quarrels with woman, and vice versa, indicates a conflict between drive and intuition.
