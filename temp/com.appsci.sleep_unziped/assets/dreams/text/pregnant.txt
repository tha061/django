Such a dream is mainly a dream for women where they see themselves in a new pleasant or frightening condition called "pregnancy." A dream about your own pregnancy may mean that in real life you are really pregnant and your subconscious mind is trying to say this in that way.
If you are not afraid of pregnancy, so the dream of pregnancy may symbolize an aspect of your personality or personal life that grows and develops, but is not yet ready for discussion or action. It represents the birth of a new idea, direction or goal.
