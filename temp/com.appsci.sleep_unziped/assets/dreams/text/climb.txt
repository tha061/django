The great and unique Sigmund Freud believed that the dream of climbing symbolizes the desire for sexual realization. What do you think about it? Do you agree with this interpretation or not? Or maybe you are climbing towards a goal or are you terribly afraid of something?
This dream may symbolize that you are "climbing" to success and now you feel that these desired dreams are almost within your reach. When you climb, what exactly do you feel? Are you full of ambitions and even more serious decisions and tasks, or do you feel fear? When answering this question, do not forget that “Pride comes before a fall”.
Do not forget to remain sincerely modest, despite your success. Your friends, family, relatives and colleges will express pleasure at your success if you'll be kind and cute as always. Selfishness and climbing too high will not lead you to anything good - most people despise arrogance.
