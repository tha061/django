The dream in which you fly can be viewed from the spiritual side and means that you are in search of freedom. For example, if you saw a sleep in which you were flying up, it symbolizes a “flight” to a more spiritual understanding of our life; if you saw a dream in which you were flying downwards means to try to understand the subconscious and everything connected with it.
Conventionally to dream of flying symbolizes sex and sexuality, but it would be more accurate to look at it from the point of view of a lack of inhibition and freedom. We free ourselves from the limitations that we can impose.
