If you had a dream about birds, you should know that it might have many meanings. You should know that since time immemorial, birds have had a reputation for troublemakers and forebodings. For example, crows and vultures are harbingers of trouble. A popular expression - "to soar like an eagle" is a metaphor of hope and confidence. Vigilance birds - another example of their positive perception.
Crows and owls symbolize wisdom and have the ability to reproduce human speech. And some people in your dreams can behave like birds; if you talk to them in your dream it may indicate a communication problem, and this is true even if the birds do not respond to you.
In order to correctly interpret your dream, you must know what kind of bird it is and what it means to you. For example, you can conduct a parallel of the similarity of people you know with birds unconsciously, and accordingly in a dream you will see these people in the form of birds.
