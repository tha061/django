This dream can symbolize your personal desire or expectation of the upcoming ceremony. People who are not interested in the wedding and do not think at all about it should look for other interpretations of this dream. First of all, you should consider other circumstances of your life. Perhaps there is some kind of commitment that you cannot accept or fulfill. And you are worried about what is happening.
In such a case, the dream of a wedding may indicate whether the given commitment is appropriate and how much you accept. If the wedding ceremony goes perfect then your union, most likely, seems reliable to you. However, if the wedding is like a catastrophe, or you cannot understand what your role is in it then there are grounds for revising your responsibilities.
