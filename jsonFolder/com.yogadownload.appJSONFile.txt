Review of our Beginner Yoga 101 Program: \"This series single-handedly got me into Yoga. I found it to be exactly the stretching I had been craving to help some hip pain (which went away.) It was also at a good pace for someone that didn't always have the best flexibility, although that is now changing. Thank you Jackie, you get full credit for making yoga relevant and enjoyable for me!\" ~ Shannon ACCESS CLASSES EVEN WHEN OFFLINE - Choose to download classes so they are stored and accessible even when you don't have an internet connection. Access yoga tutors and instructors without internet. DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT... \"I am so in love with this site! As a newbie to yoga, I was intimidated by it. But, the many classes and options really helped me get into practicing!\" ~ Devon L.",
