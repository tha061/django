  "description": "Caynax HIIT - free high intensity interval training timer for workouts like tabata, cardio etc. Have You ever wanted to burn body fat and get perfect abs? Try interval workout to burn belly fat and then Caynax Aerobic Weider Six (A6W) app to form perfect 6 pack. High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training, is an enhanced form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating periods of short intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 9\u201320 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition, improved glucose metabolism, and improved fat burning. HIIT session consists of a warm up period of exercise, followed by six to ten repetitions of high intensity exercise, separated by medium intensity exercise, and ending with a period of cool down exercise. The high intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise. The goal is to do at least six cycles, and to have the entire HIIT session last at least fifteen minutes and not more than twenty. There is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on your level cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking. The original protocol set a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30\u201340 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15\u201320 seconds of jogging or walking. HIIT is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited on time. Because of exercise intensity this type of workout is not intended for everyone. You should consult: - health doctor to determine if You are capable to perform such exercises - professional trainer to create workout schedule for You. You can use this app for workouts like: Tabata, Fartlek, Kettlebell, jumping ropes, meditation, yoga and other fitness workouts that could use timer.
