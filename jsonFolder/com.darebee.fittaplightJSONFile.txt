  "description": "A new fitness adventure with every tap! The FitTap app by DAREBEE is a fun way to stay active throughout the day or play fitness dares with your family and friends. Every tap brings you a new fitness dare - take up the challenge... and tap again!  Stay active at work: while at your desk tap the screen every hour to get a new dare\u2026 or two. Dare your friends: Take turns completing the dares and see which one of you lasts longest - or who can complete each task faster.  This is an official DAREBEE app. It was developed by the DAREBEE resource (darebee.com) and the DAREBEE Team, the creators of the visual workouts.   The paid version of this app and the free version are completely identical. By purchasing the paid version of the app you help the resource and its fundraising efforts.
