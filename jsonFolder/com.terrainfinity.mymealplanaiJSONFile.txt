  "description": "ABOUT MYMEALPLANAI: It is a one stop shop for figuring out your macronutrient needs and food planning.  You tell us what your weight goals are and what food you want to eat, we tell you how much of it to eat. MACROS: Macros, or macronutrients, are protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Along with calories, they set the foundation for any solid nutrition plan. We use the scientifically established formulas to calculate your daily caloric needs. The same formulas you find on bodybuilding websites or in any other nutrition based apps. Once you have your daily calories, we use the daily USDA guidelines to subdivide your calories into protein, carbs, and fats to create a balanced macronutrient diet. If you have your own ideas, you can always edit the macro values that we recommend.  SET GOALS: You can select between Losing Fat, Maintaining Weight, or Gaining Muscle. We did the research so we use the industry gold standard formulas to set your macros based on your weight goals.  CUSTOM MEAL PLANS: Unlike other apps where you have to figure out what to eat daily manually, our proprietary AI algorithm can create customized daily meal plans for you. Simply select a list of food, and the AI will mix and match them so that they get really close to your daily macro needs. Create multiple plans so you can plan ahead for the week! GROCERY SHOPPING: Use the app to create a grocery list based on your meal plans. Easily keep track of what you have at home and what you still need to get in the store. This will make it easier to stick to your plans and reach your fitness and weight goals. THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF NUTRITION APP: Tired of tracking your macros, but not knowing exactly what you should eat? We beat macro trackers because we take the guesswork out of the process. Pick the foods you want to eat, we tell you how much. Then you go buy them in the stores or restaurants using our grocery list functionality. Tired of googling foods to see how many calories, proteins, carbs, and fats they contain?  We are connected to a food database and do all the work for you. Tired of trying to create a perfect daily meal plan by hand and never having it come out right? Our AI will create as many daily meal plans as you want with different foods. Tired of being told to eat weird food from your expensive diet plans?  Eat the food you want, we just tell you how much so you can reach your weight goals. CONTACT: We aim to be the best nutrition app in the world. There are a lot of ideas still in development. If you have any feedback about additional features you would like included in the app, please let us know: Contact: yev@mymealplanai.com",
