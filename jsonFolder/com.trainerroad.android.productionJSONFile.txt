Some devices are ANT+ compatible on their own, but may require ANT plugins installed from the Google Play store before they\u2019re ready to use. Other devices may require an ANT+ adapter. Fortunately, some of these devices work with existing ANT+ adapters from your computer and an additional USB-C or phone-specific USB adapter. Given the various ways TrainerRoad for Android communicates via ANT+, some devices may have stronger signals than others. If you\u2019re having difficulty using a native ANT+ device, you may need an adapter to train normally.",
