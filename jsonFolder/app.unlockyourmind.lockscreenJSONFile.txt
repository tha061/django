  "description": "Would you like to get rid of the limiting thoughts of your subconscious mind? Unlock Your Mind  is an application designed to  positively influence the subconscious mind  through  motivational quotes  and  positive phrases . To do this, each time the screen of a mobile phone or tablet is unlocked, you will be able to see images with phrases that will help  stimulate communication between your conscious mind and subconscious. That's why we decided to create a powerful method for anyone to use to change their lives and achieve their goals. Our thoughts are very powerful, through them we can attract or alienate people, situations and opportunities. Bad thoughts provoke anguish, sadness and attract what we fear will happen to us. Through the  autosuggestion method , we can introduce  positive thoughts into the subconscious mind , these dominant thoughts that remain in the conscious mind reach the subconscious mind and influence it.
