MULTIPLE LANGUAGES In addition to our 6 English speaking voices, all yoga practices are available in 9 other languages! \u201cI LOVE your app. I am a physician and I recommend it to my patients all the time, for those suffering from anxiety and panic disorder to those with low back pain. I can\u2019t thank you enough for bringing yoga back into my life- making it so accessible, approachable, and convenient.\u201d -James \u201cLove it, as always. You guys have changed my life. I\u2019m not a T-Rex anymore and I can move without back pain. Thank you :)\u201d -Sharon \u201cRestorative mode is perfect for my 71 year old body!\u201d -Margaret \u201cI am absolutely thrilled with the quality of this practice. I felt like I was in a studio and I was really sweaty and challenged. Well done!\u201d -Emily \u201cAfter just one Yin session, I can feel a *huge* difference in my flexibility.\u201d - Alexandra Down Dog's terms and conditions can be found at https://www.downdogapp.com/terms Down Dog's privacy policy can be found at https://www.downdogapp.com/privacy",
