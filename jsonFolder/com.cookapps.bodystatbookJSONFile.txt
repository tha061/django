  "description": "Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker  allows you to track and chart all of your most important body measurements including weight, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, body fat percentage and  Body Mass Index (BMI) . In addition to being a weight loss tracker this app allows you to  track any custom body measurements you can think of (shoulders, skeletal muscle %, body water % etc.) on your mobile device.  What\u2019s more, you can instantly chart the changes in your body stats over time, and your data is automatically synced to the cloud if you login.   The app also includes a built-in body fat calculator and will calculate lean body mass, body fat mass, waist-to-hips ratio and daily caloric needs as well.   The app also integrates with Google Fit allowing you to import from or export weight measurements to Google Fit. The app will also import nutritional information from allowing you to see Calories Consumed, Calories Expended and Net Calories plotted against any measurement or calculated value.  This integration requires an in-app purchase.  When using a weight loss tracker, it is important to monitor not only what and how much you eat, but also your weight and other indicators of health such as body fat percentage, waist, hips etc. Since body weight can fluctuate up to 5 lbs (2.3kg) per day, it is important to weigh yourself on a regular basis and at a consistent time every day.  This way, by looking at your body measurement chart, you will be able to assess your weight loss trend over time.  Some digital scales provide an estimate of body fat percentage, which you can save within  Body Measurement Tracker  to determine whether your weight loss is a result of a desirable loss in body fat.  Alternatively, by measuring waist, neck, height and hip circumferences the app\u2019s body fat calculator will automatically calculate body fat and lean mass percentages and chart them over time.  If your lean body mass is calculated successfully, the app will also estimate your daily caloric need based on your stated activity level and sex.   Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker  is customizable allowing you to track any body measurement you can think of and ignore the ones you are not interested in.  The following measurements are included by default: - Waist - Weight - Hips - Body Fat Percentage - Body Mass Index (BMI) - Chest - Upper Arms (biceps and triceps) - Lower Arms (forearms) - Upper Legs (thighs/quads and hamstrings) - Lower Legs (calves) - Height Body Progress Photos Keep tabs of how you look over time by taking an unlimited number of pictures of your body.  Just like the rest of your data, your body progress photos are automatically synced so they can be viewed across devices, so you never have to worry about losing them ever again. Calculated Body Stats The following body stats are automatically calculated, if you have recorded the required measurements: Body Mass Index (BMI)  - The BMI is the ratio of body mass to the square of the body height and is a very commonly used index to categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.  Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke and more.   Body Fat Percentage  - The body fat percentage is the total weight of fat divided by the total body weight.  It can be estimated many ways, but since the body fat calculator relies on the measurement of height, weight and body circumferences, the Navy Method for body fat estimation is used.  This method relies on waist, neck and height measurements for males and waist, neck, height and hip measurements for females.   Waist to Hips Ratio  - The waist to hips ratio is a useful indicator of overall health.  Icons made by  Kiranshastry  from   www.flaticon.com",
