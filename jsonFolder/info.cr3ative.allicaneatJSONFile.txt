  "description": "Do you suffer from lactose, fructose, histamine, gluten, sorbitol or salicylic acid intolerance? Or do you even have several of them? No problem! With ALL i CAN EAT you have all your food intolerances under control. ALL i CAN EAT adjusts to your individual intolerances and calculates your compatibility for each food. The compatibilities are displayed in a simple traffic light system, ranging from green (very well tolerated) to yellow and orange up to red (bad idea to eat). If a recommendation does not apply to you, you can easily save your individual tolerance for the food concerned. Search quickly for a specific food, browse certain categories such as beverages, fruits, dairy products, etc. or filter compatibilites by color. In addition, ALL i CAN EAT does also provide many details such as the amounts of lactose, fructose, glucose, histamine, sorbitol, salicylic acid, amines, amino acids, etc. And in case you should miss a food, you can add it easily. You will never have to search various lists again or learn any numbers by heart! With ALL i CAN EAT you manage all your food intolerances in one place.",
