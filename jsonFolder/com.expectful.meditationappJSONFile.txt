  "description": "Hello future meditator. First\u2014bravo. No matter where you are on your parenting journey (preconception, pregnancy, motherhood), you\u2019re here. That means you\u2019re investigating ways to give your child the best start in life. You\u2019re already doing a good job. At Expectful, we\u2019re investigators too. So we peered around at the wide world of parenting. And everywhere we looked, we bumped into advice. We generally like advice, but everything we encountered was about taking care of our bodies\u2014 foods, vitamins, etc. Yet we couldn\u2019t find anything about something essential\u2014 the connection between your mind and your baby. And when we couldn\u2019t find what we were looking for, we decided to kick the investigating up a notch. We knocked on many doors\u2014 of scientific researchers, fertility experts, meditation guides, and soon to be and new parents just like you (hi). Turns out, meditation is scientifically proven to help you conceive and give your child the best start in life. Physically and psychologically. This means that when you meditate, you don\u2019t just calm yourself. You actually create the brightest environment for your baby\u2019s physical and emotional health. A simple way to make happier, healthier children and healthier, happier parents? We couldn\u2019t sit on this news. That\u2019s why we created Expectful. It\u2019s a guided meditation app for your fertility, pregnancy, and motherhood journey. SUBSCRIPTION There are two subscriptions: monthly and yearly with a free trial period.
