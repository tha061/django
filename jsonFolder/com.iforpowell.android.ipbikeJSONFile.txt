  "description": "IpBike is an app to turn your Android phone or tablet into a fully functional bike computer ideal for mounting on the bars of your bike.

See http://www.iforpowell.com/cms/index.php?page=btle-beta Barometric pressure sensor used to enhance altitude on compatible devices. Direct upload support for StriveMax, Google Fit, VeloHero, What's Today's Plan, RunKeeper, TrainingPeaks, Sporttracks.mobi, Attackpoint, Strava, Trainingstagebuch, Cycling Analytics and RunningAHEAD.  Direct email based upload for sites like ridewithgps and mapmytracks. Other sites supported by exporting .gpx or .tcx or .FIT ride files you can automate this process by using things like the DropBox or Drive apps. The main riding screens are all fully customisable for colour, size and number of items with all the stats you would expect (over 100 to choose from) plus some less common ones given suitable sensors like. 5s Avg. Power 30s Avg. Power Normalised Power IF TSS GOVSS Power Balance Torque Effectiveness Pedal Smoothness  Pedalling % Ride Avg. incline Total Ascent Current rate of climb Current Incline HRV heart rate beat to beat Gearing Coasting time Hemoglobin concentration Battery level Mapping support is either online or offline using Mobile Atlas Creator or MapsForge .map files. You can upload .fit .gpx or .kml route files to follow as you ride. Real time plot available with your critical stats updated as you ride. Multi step workouts can be designed with time, distance, heart rate or power based durations.  Targets can be power, cadence, heart rate or speed based.  Repetitions can be counts or till time or distance targets.  Support for FIT workout format file import and export.  Feedback on target and progress. Text to speech audio feedback available with customisation over what is read back and when. IpBike aims to be feature rich - comparing to stand alone bike computes its Garmin 810 class rather than Garmin 200 or 500.  If you want a simple app please look else where.  If you want lots of features please be prepared to take time to learn how to use them see http://www.iforpowell.com/cms/index.php?page=help Limitations. The free version of IpBike is limited to one million wheel revolutions (or equivalent in gps only mode 2070mm wheel).  For permanent use after this you will need to get the IpBikeKey app which will unlock this limitation. IpBike uses IpSensorMan to provide access to ANT+, Btle and BlueTooth sensors.  If you have a compatible phone and do not have IpSensorMan installed you will be prompted to install it.  You can use an ANT USB Stick if your phone supports USB host mode.  For Hrv, Muscle Oxygen, Remote Control, FEC, Suspension, Bike light, Shifting and Btle you need the beta version see http://www.iforpowell.com/cms/index.php?page=IpSensorMan-beta If IpBike fails to start up on your device the most common cause is an issue with the Google maps setup.  The release page has a version without Google Maps support you can try.  http://www.iforpowell.com/cms/index.php?page=releases",
