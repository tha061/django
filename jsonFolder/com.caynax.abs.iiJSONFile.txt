  "description": "Legendary ABS II workout - Caynax ABS II - for perfect six pack. Try it after daily ab workout - Caynax A6W, and forget about any other abdominal workouts. About workout This app helps you do workout known as 'Legendary Abs II'. This workout is result of four years' research at Stanford University. It guarantees greater effects than any other workout and doesn't take more than 5 minutes. The secret The secret of this workout is how exercises interact with each other. That way they are much more effective. Fat and diet You won't see your belly muscles if they are covered with belly fat. You need to get rid of that fat first. You can achieve it simply by burning more calories than you consume - proper diet and aerobic exercises. You can also try Caynax HIIT app for interval workouts. Belly muscles Belly muscles can be divided in two parts: upper abs and lower abs. You use both lower and upper abs when you do lower abs exercises and only upper abs when you do upper abs exercises. Always start with lower abs exercises. Application is supported by in-app ads and has some limitations. Permissions: - READ_PHONE_STATE - used to detect incoming phone call and pause workout. - RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - to start reminder service after phone start. - ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, INTERNET - ads. - WAKE_LOCK - to ensure that workout works when screen is off.",
