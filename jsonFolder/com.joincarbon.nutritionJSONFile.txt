  "description": "Carbon Diet Coach is your solution for results that LAST. Whether your goal is to lose fat, build muscle, improve your metabolism, or simply maintain your weight, Carbon Diet Coach removes the guesswork. Carbon Diet Coach is a science-based nutrition app designed by renowned nutrition coaches Dr. Layne Norton (Ph.D. Nutritional Sciences), Holly Baxter (MS Dietetics), and Registered Dietitian Keith Kraker (BS Dietetics). It does everything a normal nutrition coach would but at a fraction of the cost. Simply select your goal, answer a few short questions, and it does the rest! You will get a customized nutrition plan based on YOUR goals and metabolism. What's more, Carbon will adjust the plan as you progress to optimize your results. If you hit a plateau or stall, Carbon will make adjustments to keep you progressing towards your goal, just like any good coach would. Our coaching system uses the latest techniques in nutrition science to make sure you get the best results possible. All you need to do is follow these simple steps: \u2022 Log your food using the built-in food tracker \u2022 Log your body weight \u2022 Check-in each week Do that and Carbon does the rest! Carbon Diet Coach can do things other nutrition coaching apps can\u2019t do. For example, your nutrition plan can be tailored to your diet preference: \u2022 Balanced \u2022 Low Carb \u2022 Low Fat \u2022 Ketogenic \u2022 Plant-Based Each setting is completely customizable so that you receive a plan that is sustainable for YOU! Another feature that makes Carbon unique is the diet planner. Want high and low-calorie days rather than eating the same foods every day? Use the diet planner to set up your week and stay on track. Overate on one day and not sure what to do with your nutrition plan for the rest of the week? Adjust the diet planner to account for what you overate and Carbon does the rest! Other coaching features include: \u2022 Adjustable check-in days \u2022 Check-in explanations so you're never left wondering why the app did or didn\u2019t make a change \u2022 Check-in history so you can look back and see why the app made various adjustments \u2022 Charts showing your weight, body fat, lean body mass, calorie intake, protein intake, carbohydrate intake, fat intake, and metabolic rate \u2022 Early check-in feature for those who can\u2019t always check in on their specified day \u2022 Goal tracker so you can see the progress you\u2019ve made and how close you are to your goal \u2022 Recommendations after you reach a goal so you can plan for what's next and KEEP your results Already know what you are doing with nutrition and don\u2019t need Carbon to coach you? No problem, you can enter your nutrition targets and simply use the food tracker. Beyond the amazing coaching features of this app is a food tracker that's excellent in its own right. Its features include: \u2022 A huge food database \u2022 Barcode scanner \u2022 Quick add macros \u2022 Copy meals \u2022 Favorite foods \u2022 Create custom foods \u2022 Create custom recipes No matter what your goal is, Carbon Diet Coach is your solution.
