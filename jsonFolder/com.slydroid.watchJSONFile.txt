WIKI information: High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) or sprint interval training (SIT), is a form of interval training, an exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less-intense recovery periods. HIIT is a form of cardiovascular exercise. Usual HIIT sessions may vary from 4\u201330 minutes. These short, intense workouts provide improved athletic capacity and condition as well as improved glucose metabolism.[1] Compared with other regimens, HIIT may not be as effective for treating hyperlipidemia and obesity, or improving muscle and bone mass. Some researchers also note that HIIT requires \"an extremely high level of subject motivation,\" and question whether the general population could safely or practically tolerate the extreme nature of the exercise regimen. Metabolic effects: HIIT significantly lowers insulin resistance compared to continuous training or control conditions and leads to modestly decreased fasting blood glucose levels and weight loss compared to those who do not undergo a physical activity intervention. The countdown is running!",
