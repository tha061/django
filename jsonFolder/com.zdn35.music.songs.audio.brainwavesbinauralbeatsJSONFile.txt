Music therapy is the use of sounds to improve health or functional outcomes. Music therapy is a creative arts therapy, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses melodies and all of its facets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dphysical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto help clients improve their physical and mental health. Our brainwaves change according to what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing and feeling. When slower brainwaves are dominant we can feel tired, slow, sluggish, or dreamy. The higher frequencies are dominant when we feel wired, or hyper-alert.   The descriptions that follow are only broad descriptions - in practice things are far more complex, and brainwaves reflect different aspects when they occur in different locations in the brain.    Brainwave speed is measured in Hertz (cycles per second) and they are divided into bands delineating slow, moderate, and fast waves.",
