  "description": "Take your Yoga Classes to the next level! Expand your knowledge, become a better Yoga teacher! Groundbreaking new premium software in the field of YOGA.  Who It Benefits? This comprehensive professional software was built especially for Yoga teachers who are interested in deepening their understanding of the anatomical, kinesiological and motor components of Yoga and to improve the quality of their teaching and instruction.  Ever wished you could learn how to diagnose your students\u2019 posture patterns? Now you can! The professional collaboration between Dr. Gill Solberg and Amit Gal Alon takes the world of Yoga a few steps forward and creates a compulsory visual tool for every student/teacher who is interested in deepening his/her understanding of the movement and posture system during yoga practice. This is an opportunity to learn from top-notch professionals and to raise their instructional quality by several levels.  All of the content is presented visually, in spectacular 3D, to help teachers deal with questions that arise during instruction such as: - What does this position work on? - What might be the source of the learner\u2019s difficulty? Knowledge in these areas will enable teachers to work with confidence, from a well-grounded understanding of body movement, which will help avoid causing harm as the result of an inappropriate yoga practice.- How can we deal with movement limitations during the yoga practice?  --------------------------------------------- All of our plans include unlimited access to the content. 3D animation, videos, muscular anatomy explanations, kinesiology & skeletal videos and more. You can cancel at any time through the iTunes store settings. Plans automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renew in your iTunes account 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period. If you\u2019re not ready for unlimited access, you can still get access to selected videos and explanations in each chapter of the app. All details are in our terms of use and privacy policy.
