AI Workouts and Adaptation - Reach your goals with a long-term, science-based approach to fitness, and workouts that learn and adapt from set to set and from workout to workout. - Adapt to thrive - your lifestyle is not stagnant, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll adapt your planning based on your activity levels and sleep.  - Make sustained progress with intelligent progression of sets, reps and weight in the gym, and a huge range of bodyweight progressions at home.

Learn the correct movements with demonstration videos and detailed descriptions. Your Own Mobile Personal Trainer Just as a good personal trainer will personalize your workout plan, BodBot creates an individual program for you and adapts it as you progress. Limited range of motion in the shoulders? We can work to correct that. Weaker in the back than in the chest? We can address that. Hamstrings too tight? Want to develop the biceps or the glutes? Can only workout in a few windows during the week? BodBot can handle it all, and your workouts will reflect all of these needs. We're committed to providing you with the best possible training plan and the very best workouts. More than this, if you miss a workout, or if you decide to go hiking on a whim, we can integrate this new information and update your training plan accordingly. The plan lives and breathes with you and for you.  Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get started.",
