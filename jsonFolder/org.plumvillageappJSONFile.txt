Ask Thay includes hundreds of real-life questions asked to the Zen Master, like \u201cHow can we let go of anger? and \u201cHow can I stop worrying?\u201d His answers are compassionate and infused with insight.  Dharma Talks are teachings given by Thich Nhat Hanh on how to bring Buddhist wisdom and mindfulness into our life. Rather than discussing theoretical concepts, he focuses on direct and clear teachings to relieve suffering and create happiness in our day to day lives. Topics include depression, PTSD, relationships, sexual abuse, fear, and dealing with strong emotions. Resources In Resources you can find a library of  daily practices, chants, poems, and songs. These bring to life the practices taught in Plum Village monasteries around the world and offer ways to bring mindfulness into our world, wherever we are.  Bell of Mindfulness In Plum Village monasteries bells of mindfulness chime at regular intervals. Everybody stops and takes three mindful breaths to pause from their thinking or talking, breathe, and return to their bodies. The Bell of Mindfulness allows us to have the same reminder on our phone.  We can customize the bell to chime at different time periods. Settings include: \u2022 Start time / End time \u2022 Chime intervals \u2022 Bell volume \u2022 Daily repeating schedule ------------------------------------ Why not give the Plum Village app a try and see how you can benefit from it?
