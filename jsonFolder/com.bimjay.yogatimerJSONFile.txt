  "description": "Yoga Timer is an easy to use and discreet timer app especially made for yoga, meditation and other workouts where you don't want to interact with your timer alarms during your exercises. With Yoga Timer there is  no need for you to interrupt yourself to silence any timer alarms , instead you are discretely notified that the time is up for that part and then it automatically continues with the next timer. Try out the example workouts or create your own workouts with your lists of exercises (timers), visual and optional audio feedback and different forms of repeats available. \u2022\u2022\u2022  As seen on the Google Developer Live shows \"The App Clinic\" and \"Developers Strike back\"! \u2022\u2022\u2022 FREE The app is ad-supported but they will not start showing until after 7 days and you can remove the ads with a standard Google Play in-app purchase. MODERN FEATURES It is a modern Android application using the simple but elegant Android design guidelines while still being available for Android 2.3 and newer devices. On Android 4.1+ it takes advantage of the enhanced notifications. Optimized for both phone and tablet use and you can choose from different color themes (dark/light etc). Colored status bar and translucent navigation bar, Android 5 styled notifications and the beginnings of Android Wear support, the list goes on. Share your workouts with Android Beam! On supported devices hold it next to another phone or tablet, back to back, and tap to confirm and the workout is shared in a second, no cables, no setup. Simple.  Of course there is an automatic backup of your workouts and settings automatically restored when moving to a new phone or after doing a factory reset. QUESTIONS?
