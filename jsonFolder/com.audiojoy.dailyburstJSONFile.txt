  "description": "DailyBurst is a once daily personal development app that makes it easy and fun to improve the areas of your life that are most important to you. Whether you want to have better friendships, be happier, be more motivated, stop feeling sad, have a positive outlook on life, better health and wellness or just be peaceful, content and happy \u2014 Daily Burst is the app for you. JUST 7 MINUTES DAILY: Pause for 7 minutes each day, once a day, whenever is convenient, and listen to an amazing audio track that will teach you techniques and simple strategies to improve just about every area of your life. When people are asked:  Hey, motivational and inspirational affirmations really work. Along with some proven personal development advice, you're going to learn to be happy and fulfilled. \u201cWhat do you most want to improve in your life?\u201d \u2014 most people say the same things: IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOVED ONES  |  HAVE MORE JOB SATISFACTION  |  MAKE AN BIGGER IMPACT  |  HAVE LESS STRESS & ANXIETY  |  PURSUE PASSIONS AND GOALS  |  HAVE MORE GRATITUDE & PEACE  |  PRACTICE MINDFULNESS & SPIRITUALITY  |  STOP WORRYING SO MUCH  |  HAVE MORE FREE TIME  Have you ever wanted any of these things? You\u2019re not alone. There are literally millions of books, websites, blogs, newsletters, Youtube videos, courses, workshops and more ways to improve your life. Without a doubt, these things all work. But most of us still don\u2019t do it. When people are asked:  \"Why don\u2019t you do focus on improving the things that are important to you?\"\u2014 most people say the same things: I\u2019M TOO BUSY  |  I\u2019M TOO DISTRACTED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA  |  I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT TO DO FIRST  |  IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME  |  I STARTED BUT THEN I GAVE UP These are all real reasons and we all have them. DailyBurst has taken all of the best self improvement information available and condensed it into 7 minute daily audio tracks, ultra simple challenges and inspirational messages to get you on the right track and to keep at it. You might say, 7 minutes, that\u2019s not enough time to make any real progress. But that\u2019s just not true. 7 minutes is probably 7 times longer than what you\u2019re doing right now. Here's how it works: 1) Get a daily motivational quotes notification 2) Open the app and see a beautiful and happy inspirational image 3) Listen to a 5 minute lifestyle wellness audio track professionally written and recorded 4) Read the daily happiness challenge and just do it DAILY PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES ARE EASY - Drink 3 cups of water, stretch as soon as you wake up, say hi to someone you don\u2019t know, take a short walk at lunch, call your mom and more like that. Habit research shows that in order to build a healthy habit you also have to break down unhealthy ones. Part of that means building a habit of doing healthy things. DAILY INSPIRATION QUOTES ARE EMPOWERING - Whether you think they are silly or not, the fact is that they work. Here is an example: \u201cThose who don\u2019t believe in magic will never find it.\u201d When you read this, you\u2019re brain chemistry actually alters and you become more open to experiencing magic that day. DAILY SELF HELP EXPERIENCES & ADVICE CREATES CHANGE - When you listen to a personal story from someone that has actually experienced a challenge and overcome that challenge, then hear the lessons learned by that person, you will be able to create the same results for yourself. The most important aspect is to keep it simple and focus on one thing at a time. Self help books do the opposite. They teach too much too fast, and you forget.  Hey, motivational and inspirational affirmations really work. Along with some proven personal development advice, you're going to learn to be happy and fulfilled. DailyBurst is guaranteed to make your life better & be the one app you open up every single day for 7 minutes. That\u2019s it. Try it and be amazed at your progress in just a few days.",
