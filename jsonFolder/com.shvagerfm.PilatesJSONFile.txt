  "description": "Pull out your gym mat and get ready to do a series of movements that will stabilize and strengthen your core. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get stronger, more sculpted muscles and gain flexibility. You may also have better posture and a better sense of well-being. If you are looking to strengthen your abdomen and pelvis as well as maintain good posture, then Pilates is for you. It also has a strong mind/body connection, so you may like it if you enjoy yoga but need a more intense core workout. There is limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate lower back pain, improve strength, and prevent elderly people from falling. It has not been shown to be effective treatment for any medical condition. Pilates is great for strengthening and toning your core and for increasing your flexibility, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a comprehensive strength building program. You will need to supplement it with some other exercises if you want to build up your arm or calf muscles. Talk to your trainer to see what would be best. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget your cardio! Pilates involves precise moves and specific breathing techniques. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for you if you prefer a less structured program. It also won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit your needs if you are looking for an aerobic workout. Pilates can be very demanding, so start slowly. Instructors do not have to be licensed, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to get recommendations before selecting one.",
