Measuring your 1RM can put your body under great stress, so be sure to perform it under safe conditions.  Studies revealed that no more than 10 repetitions should be used in linear equations to estimate your 1RM.  We included the possibility to calculate your 1RM also for 10 to 20 repetitions, please be aware that any 1RM calculation that result from values over 10 repetitions can only be considered as rough estimation.",
