  "description": "The BEST app for @home Body-Sculpting Spinning, TRX and other Full-Body workouts.   Our online workout library contains hundreds of calorie-crushing workouts like Spinning, TRX, Boot Camps, Stretch & Restore, Ab & Core, HIIT Training, Kettlebells and more, like our most popular class - Spin Sculpt, which combines fat torching Spinning with Full-Body Toning & Strength exercises. And expect multiple NEW CLASS RELEASES EVERY WEEK! At Studio SWEAT onDemand (SSoD), we don\u2019t use actors, fitness models or staged scenes. Rather, we use real trainers, leading live workouts to real people just like you... so you\u2019ll feel extremely motivated, and like you\u2019re actually in the studio working out right along side us. And these classes are led by an amazing team of trainers you can select from, including SSoD founder, Cat Kom. Special App Features Include: Unlimited Workout Streams for SSoD All Access Pass Holders Ability to Purchase & Download a Class Directly to Your Device (no more syncing with your PC) Option to Build a List of Class Favorites Feature to Mark Classes as Watched Shop SSoD Apparel and Equipment Connect with SSoD via Social Media SSoD Fitness & Nutrition Articles and Trainer Tip Videos And More! Yes, with this app you can buy Single Classes to download directly to your device or, better yet, SSoD All Access Pass holders (available on studiosweatondemand.com) can easily stream UNLIMITED workouts through this app or their other favorite Internet ready device, like a Smart TV for example. Plus, you can use any indoor cycling bike for our world famous Spinning workouts, and for the other workouts we keep the equipment to a minimum so you can easily and affordably get your SWEAT on! No need to buy a pricey bike from us! We're bike agnostic and think it's crazy to spend thousands of dollars and be forced into a lengthy contract, so just pick your favorite bike for a price that fits your budget and we'll do our part to keep you motivated to ride it! The proof is in the pudding when it comes to our workouts, and you CAN expect results. We have people recovering from injuries, coming back from pregnancies, training for outdoor rides, and just getting over being flat out unhealthy becoming much more lean and strong because SSoD workouts promote cardio and strength, and because we keep you interested and wanting more.",
