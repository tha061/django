  "description": "Revive - Weight Loss is a new way to improve your well-being everyday. Unlike other weight loss apps that focus on calorie counting, Revive helps you track and improve your eating habits, for a more lasting impact. Revive is made for you, if: > You wish to acquire better eating habits in order to get back in shape, improve your general well-being and lose weight. > You do not believe anymore in unsustainable restrictive diet plans, whose effects never last. > You are willing to track your meals, but only if it's \"quick, fast and fun\" (because classic calorie counting is super tedious). > You don't want to count calories your whole life. HOW IT WORKS: > Intelligent: Each day, Revive gives you a list of advices and tips, customised to your needs. > Easy: You will input your meals via a unique system based on portion tracking. In a few seconds, Revive tells you if you had a very healthy day (Green colour), if the day was average (Yellow colour), or if you have a lot of corrections to make (Orange colour). String together as many Green days as possible to reach your weight loss goals! > Complete: Nutrition tips, exercice, sleep, anti-stress, recipes, etc. Everything is important to lose weight. It's not just about your plate! Questions? Feedback? You can reach us here: team@get-revive.com.",
