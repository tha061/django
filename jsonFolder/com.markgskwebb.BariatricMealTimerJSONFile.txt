  "description": "This app was born out of necessity. Since I had gastric bypass surgery in July 2017, I've tried a lot of ways to make sure I get as many nutrients as I need. The best way I've personally found is to eat for two minutes, then take a break for two minutes, and repeat this until I can't eat any more. I couldn't find a decent app that could do what I needed, so I decided to make one. Bariatric Meal Timer plays a short sound effect, vibrates the device briefly, and changes color of on-screen elements, depending on whether it's time to eat or rest. Available intervals for each timer range from thirty seconds, one minute, through five minutes. By default, the timer is set to two minutes. Features include a themes, the ability to enable or disable sounds and haptics, a night mode, and a summary screen that displays before the timer begins. There are no ads or in-app purchases. If you love the app and find it useful, please rate it five stars. I will never interrupt your use of the app to ask you to rate it.",
