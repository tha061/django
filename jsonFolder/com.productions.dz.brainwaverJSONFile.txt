  "description": "Brain Waver allows full control over a Binaural Beats Generator with 18 high-definition relaxing background audio tracks also included for free!  Binaural Beats use a theory called Brainwave Entrainment. Your brainwaves will naturally match the generated beats per second over approximately 15 minutes when using headphones at low to medium volume. This technique allows you to enter many different states of consciousness for Meditation, Sleep, and Concentration. Close your eyes and focus only on your breathing for best results! The second Advanced Binaural Generator, found in the left slide out drawer, can fade between initial and ending Beats Per Second values to gently guide users towards their desired brainwave state. This second Generator can be played on top of the first for interesting multi-Binaural effects. Using the same Center Tone for both Generators (or slightly offset, I.E. 198 Hz for Basic and 200 Hz for Advanced) can also create mind bending Binaural interference patterns. This app can also be used as a White Noise Generator for sleeping  by setting the Binaural Beats volume to low or zero and choosing a background audio.
