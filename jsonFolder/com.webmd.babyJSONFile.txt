  "description": "Over 1.7 million parents have downloaded the WebMD Baby app to track their baby\u2019s development and get trusted, physician-approved advice.  In this single, free app, you\u2019ll have the right resources to raise your newborn. Five comprehensive tools to keep track of important needs and stay on schedule: - Breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, and solid-food trackers \u2013 record and review all your feeding and nursing sessions, including both breast milk and formula.  - Sleep tracker:  Records not only time of each session, but location such as crib, car seat, stroller, and more. - Diaper tracker: Keep track of each diaper change -- dry, wet, or both. - Growth tracker:  Allows you to record height, weight, and head circumference. - Baby Book: Capture your baby's memories and share them with collaborators. (Note: videos cannot be shared or backed up due to file sizes) - The nursing and feeding trackers allow you to schedule reminders and even base them on previous feedings. - Collaborate with your partner, relatives, or caregiver to keep track of all your child\u2019s needs.
