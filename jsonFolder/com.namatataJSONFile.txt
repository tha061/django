You will find exercises based on breathing. What are the benefits of meditation? In the world, mindfulness is booming. Inspired by the MBSR and MBCT program, the power of the present moment makes it possible to manage : - stress. - anxiety. - social phobia,  - burnout. - depression. You've probably already said to yourself, \"I think too much,\" or \"How can I better manage my stress?\" Meditating day after day also helps to improve sleep, to reduce insomnia, to find well-being, relaxation, to be calm and zen like a baby panda eating a little bamboo. It's your happiness cheat sheet! These exercises, some of which are taken from hypnosis will be of great help to you in case of depression, to manage your stress or to be more positive in everyday life. Amateurs of ASMR, Antoine's gentle voice will plunge you into the silence of meditation. A few sessions will be enough to help you sleep and be more positive. The flow of thoughts (emotions, memories, etc...) flows continuously in our mind. We always think about what we have to do, what we have to remember,... By dint of being in the future or the past, we forget the present moment. Taking time for oneself, setting up a relaxation routine, being positive and zen are important factors for even more effective well-being and personal development. Enter the silence of meditation and learn how to manage your stress over the long term. Meditating, refocusing on the present moment, is a precious help in the fight against depression, an aid to sleep and regain quality sleep. If you have any questions, send us an email. We will be happy to answer them. See you in a minute!",
